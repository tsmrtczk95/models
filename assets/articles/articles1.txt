Terendak is a type of conical hat or head covering, usually made from woven nipah leaves, bamboo, or rattan. 

It is made to be durable, beautified with unique motifs, patterns, and colors.

It is one of cultural heritage of the Melanau community in Sarawak, and it is also used as an accessory in their traditional costumes. In addition, it is also as a decorative item in the Melanau household, or as gift for weddings or official ceremonies.

Nowadays, the terendak worn by the Melanau people serves more as a complementary accessory to their traditional attire, often worn during the Kaul Festival, or other cultural celebrations.
