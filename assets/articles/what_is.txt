A Terendak is a headwear that is conical-shaped. It is made of nipah leaves, feathers or rattan. The invention requires the ability to make a weaving to make a beautiful tendak.
In Sarawak, the wearing of head coverings has long been used since the arrival of Chinese immigrants in Sarawak. The Chinese community who came to Sarawak in the past used their tendak while doing gold mining work in Sarawak.

For the Sarawak community, the terdak is used by fishermen when they catch fish in the sea. 
In line with the passage of time, terendak is now a must-have accessory for the traditional costumes of the Melanau people that are often used when attending the Kaul Festival or the traditional festivals of the Melanau community.
Today, terendak is also a tourist attraction that visits the majority of the Melanau areas such as Matu and Igan. Today, it is also a beautiful and unique home decor.
